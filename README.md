# Protect-Data
The project aims to develop a secure system for managing student grades, focusing on safeguarding the confidentiality of grade information. The system allows teachers to input student grades, encrypt them using RSA encryption, and store them on the Cloud Firestore database. Students can securely access and decrypt their grades for viewing.
