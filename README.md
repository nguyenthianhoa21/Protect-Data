# Protect-Data
The project aims to develop a secure system for managing student grades, focusing on safeguarding the confidentiality of grade information. The system allows teachers to input student grades, encrypt them using RSA encryption, and store them on the Cloud Firestore database. Students can securely access and decrypt their grades for viewing.
# Development Approach:

Utilizes Firebase's Cloud Firestore as the online database for storing encrypted grade information.
Implements the RSA encryption algorithm to secure the input and retrieval of student grades, ensuring that only authorized users can comprehend and process the information.
Creates a user-friendly interface for grade input and secure decryption, enhancing both security and convenience.
This project addresses the critical need for enhancing information security in student grade management while providing a convenient and secure method for accessing data for both teachers and students.
